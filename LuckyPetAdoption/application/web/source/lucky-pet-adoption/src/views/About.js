            Lucky Pet Adoption Agency is a company that was birthed from the
            mind of President Chris Scott, who at a young age had a love of
            animals and decided to dedicate his life to finding homes for pets
            who were either or abandoned and needed loving homes. The company
            was started in 1980, with just one small location in a small
            strip-mall on the west side of Philadelphia. Today, this company
            boast branches all over the east coast with plans to move into the
            South with locations being designed for the Texas and Mississippi
            areas.
